binary-search-algorithm
This repository demonstrates the implementation of the Binary Search Algorithm using Python. Binary Search is a highly efficient searching technique with O(log n) time complexity that finds the position of a target element in a sorted array. The project includes a well-documented Python script, user input handling, and example usage for education
Binary Search Algorithm (Python)

This repository contains a simple implementation of the *Binary Search Algorithm* in Python.  
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm used to find the position of a target element within a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

About
Binary Search reduces the time complexity of searching compared to a linear search (O(n)) by achieving *O(log n)* performance.  
It only works on *sorted arrays* and is widely used in real-world applications such as databases, libraries, and computer systems.

How It Works
1. Start with the entire sorted array.  
2. Find the middle element.  
3. If the middle element equals the target, return its index.  
4. If the target is smaller, search the left half; otherwise, search the right half.  
5. Repeat until the target is found or the search space is empty.
