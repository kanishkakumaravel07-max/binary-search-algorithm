# binary-search-algorithm
This repository demonstrates the implementation of the Binary Search Algorithm using Python. Binary Search is a highly efficient searching technique with O(log n) time complexity that finds the position of a target element in a sorted array. The project includes a well-documented Python script, user input handling, and example usage for education
